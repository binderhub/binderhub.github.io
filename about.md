After trying several collection/albums organizing websites online I've come to the conclusion that they Take too much work for me to add my cards and do not display them exactly to my specifications (printing, order, etc.).

This is why I created BinderHub to make it easier for me to manage digital albums of MTG cards.

Disclaimer: requires a bit of knowledge in installing and running code packages as Well as working with git.

The way it works:

Clone GitHub repository: https://github.com/binderhub/binderhub.github.io

Create your own GitHub pages repository.

Under _binders create binders as directories.

Under each binder directory create a txt file for each page within the binder with scryfall links to the cards you want (each link in its own line).

Follow instructions on how to build the website on BinderHub's GitHub README https://github.com/binderhub/binderhub.github.io

Hope this is useful for others!

Would appreciate any Feedback/help.
